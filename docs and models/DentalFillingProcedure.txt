Drilling Steps:
1. Use dental handpiece with bur to drill into the tooth and remove decay.
2. Use spoon excavator to remove soft decay
3. Create proper form and shape of the cavity using a handpiece

Filling steps:
1. Apply etching agent to the cavity using a brush
2. Let it stand for 15 seconds then wash with water and dry using forced air
3. Apply bonding agent to the cavity using a brush.
4. Let it stand for 15 seconds, then dry using forced air
5. Fill the cavity using the composite material using a syringe like tool. Over fill just a little
6. Use a condenser to pack the material into the cavity
7. Use burnisher to make the material stick to take the form of the edges of the cavity
8. Use UV light set the material or harden it (3-5 seconds)
